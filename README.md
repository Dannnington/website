# bean.codes v7

Version 7 of [bean.codes](https://www.bean.codes). Created entirely with React, based on create-react-app. (This was my first React project, apologies if the code is low-quality or if I made mistakes. Please open a PR if you would like to help improve on the code.)

### How to run this project
Simply `yarn start` and React's compiler will do all of its' auto-compilation magic for you! It will automatically open a page in your browser to `localhost:3000` and will automatically compile your code on file save.

To create a production-ready build, simply run `yarn build` and React will compile and roll-up all of your code into the `build/` directory.
